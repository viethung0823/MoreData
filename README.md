## Introduction
I aim to develop this plugin to enable viewing of CSV files directly within Obsidian, eliminating the need to use a separate application. This plugin will leverage the capabilities of the DataView plugin to query data. Furthermore, it will allow linking queried data to other notes, providing a convenient way to manage and reuse all queries from a single location.
This plugin currently supports viewing CSV files within Obsidian. However, I am actively working on extending its capabilities to support more file types in the future. As with any evolving project, there may be occasional bugs. I welcome and appreciate any contributions to the project, whether it's reporting issues or helping with code improvements. Your involvement will help me make this plugin more robust and versatile.


## Features

- View CSV files inside Obsidian (will support more file types in the future)
- Separate dataview files
- Command to create a new dataview file
